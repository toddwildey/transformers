## Vector estimation training

Training models to combine feature vectors for specific language models into summary feature vectors using a a text dataset.

There are two sets of scripts provided. The first set leverages the Trainer API. The second set with `no_trainer` in the suffix uses a custom training loop and leverages the ğŸ¤— Accelerate library . Both sets use the ğŸ¤— Datasets library. You can easily customize them to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.

The following examples, will run on datasets hosted on our [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or with your own
text files for training and validation. We give examples of both below.

### Estimating summary feature vectors for GPT-2

The following example trains a model to estimate the feature vector output by GPT-2 for a batch of text using feature vectors output by GPT-2 for subsections of the same text.

To run on your own training and validation files, use the following command:

```bash
source .env/bin/activate

python examples/pytorch/vector-estimation/run_ve_no_trainer.py \
    --dataset_name "../data/gpt2-large/wikimedia/wikipedia/20231101.en" \
    --output_dir "../models/gpt2-large_iterator-linear/" \
    --resume_from_checkpoint "../models/gpt2-large_iterator-linear/" \
    --checkpointing_steps 100000 \
    2>&1 | tee output
```
